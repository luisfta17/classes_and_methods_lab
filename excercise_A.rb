# For this part we want you to make a class that represents a CodeClan student.
#
# Create a class called Student that takes in a name (String) and a cohort (integer) when an new instance is created.
# Create a couple of Getter methods, one that returns the name property and one that returns the cohort property of the student.
# Add in Setter methods to update the students name and what cohort they are in.
# Create a method that gets the student to talk (eg. Returns "I can talk!).
# Create a method that takes in a students favourite programming language and returns it as part of a string (eg. student1.say_favourite_language("Ruby") -> "I love Ruby").


class Student
  def initialize(name, cohort)
    @name = name
    @cohort = cohort
  end

  def get_name
    @name
  end

  def get_cohort
    @cohort
  end

  def set_name(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end

  def set_cohort(new_cohort)
    @cohort = new_cohort
